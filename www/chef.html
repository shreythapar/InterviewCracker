        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Chef published a blog post, and is now receiving many queries about it. On day ith, he receives Qi queries. 
            But Chef can answer at most k queries in a single day.Chef always answers the maximum number of questions 
            that he can on any given day (note however that this cannot be more than k). The remaining questions (if any) 
            will be carried over to the next day.Fortunately, after n days, the queries have stopped. Chef would like to 
            know the first day during which he has some free time, i.e. the first day when he answered less than k questions.
        </p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>First line will contain T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.</li>
            <li>The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers n and k.</li>
            <li>The second line of each testcase contains n space separated integers, namely Q1, Q2, ... Qn.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            For each testcase, output in a single line the first day during which chef answers less than kk questions.
        </p>
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1≤T≤1051≤T≤105</li>
            <li>1≤1≤ sum of n over all testcases ≤105≤105</li>
            <li>1≤k≤1081≤k≤108</li>
            <li>0≤Qi≤1080≤Qi≤108</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Subtask</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Subtask 1 - 20% points - Sum of Qi over all testcases and days ≤3.106≤3.106</li>
            <li>Subtask 2 - 80% points - Original constraints</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>We start the solution by gathering all the required details from the question, like it is mentioned that chef receives 
            Qi queries every day which indicates we have to make an array. Size of array is n as it is given that after nth day 
            queries stop, chef can only answer k questions in one day, if any number of questions remain, they should be answered 
            next day along with fresh queries that come on that day. So, now chef wants to know after which day he would be free 
            for some time, that is, on which day he would answer less queries than he canso that he can get some time off. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We will start by taking inputs as directed in the question. One approach could be:
        </p>
        <p>
            As I have stated above i.e. by making an array wherein, we can store queries for each day. Answer the maximum number 
            of queries that we can and pass remaining to next day, that is, we subtract queries that can be answered and add remaining 
            to next day’s queries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of using an array we could use two temporary variables, one that stores query for that day and second stores copy 
            of it. We can subtract maximum queries that can be answered on that day from second variable and add the remaining ones. 
            We use that first temporary variable to take the input for the next day. We use a counter variable to count number of days 
            for which queries were more than maximum. And keep on subtracting maximum from the variable that is storing remaining number 
            of queries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If for any day value of variable is than maximum number of queries that can be answered then this day is the first free day 
            and we print counter variable’s value. We are using greedy approach, as we check if current day is the free day and then we 
            move to next day other than taking sum of all queries and then dividing to find the answer.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Input t</li>
            <li>While t is greater than 0</li>
            <li>&emsp; Input n and k</li>
            <li>&emsp; Initialize temporary(temp) variable to 0</li>
            <li>&emsp; Initialize counter(count) variable to 0</li>
            <li>&emsp; For I =0 to n</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp; Input Qi</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp; temp = temp + Qi</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp; If (temp is less than k)</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Print count</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Break the loop</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp; Else</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; temp = temp – k</li>
            <li>&emsp; If (temp is greater than k)</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp; Print (n+(temp+1)/k)</li>
        </ol>
