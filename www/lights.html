        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Johnny is playing Lights Out, an electronic game consisting of an NxN grid of lights. Initially, each 
            light may be on or off. Pressing a light will toggle it and the lights non-diagonally adjacent to it.<br>
            The object of the game is to try and get all the lights turned off. It is not always possible, and what's 
            more, Johnny's game is faulty. Pressing some lights has no effect. (They can still be turned on and off if 
            they are next to working lights.)<br> Help Johnny write a program that checks whether a puzzle can be solved or 
            not, given the initial description of the grid and the positions of the faulty lights.
        </p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>
            The first line contains a number t (about 10), the number of test cases. Each test case has the following form:<br>
            The first line contains two numbers N and K (2 <= N <= 200, 0 <= K <= N). Each line in the next N lines contains 
            N characters '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the grid. '1' denotes a light that is on and '0' a light 
            that is off.<br> Each line in the next K lines contains 2 integers, i and j (1 <= i, j <= N), representing the row 
            and column of a faulty light. Rows are numbered from the top and columns from the left.
        </p>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            For each test case, print YES if there is a solution, otherwise print NO.
        </p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            There is a game in which we have a nxn grid with lights. Changing state of one light changes state of its 4 nearest 
            neighbors. But there are few faulty lights in this grid, for them changing their state doesn’t change state of its 
            nearest neighbors. At the end we want to turn off all the lights in the grid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We start by taking inputs as directed in the question, we make a structure with two fields one is state (Boolean) 
            stores state of light (on or off) and another condition (character) stores condition of light (‘w’-working, ‘f’-faulty). 
            Then we take input for all lights in the grid and assign their condition and we take position of faulty light and change 
            its condition from previously taken input.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will three functions:
            <br>Solve: it is center function that solves the grid if it can be solved. We check few conditions in this function to solve the grid.
            <br>Changestate: it changes the state of light in focus and its 4 nearest neighbors.
            <br>Adjacent: it checks if at least two neighbors of light in focus have their state as ‘on’.    
            <br>Now, in solve function we will start with first light and check if its state is ‘on’ and it is in working condition, 
            then we check if changing its state changes state of at least two ‘on’ neighbors. If all conditions are true, we call changestate 
            function and change state of its neighbors. This procedure is repeated for light in every row and when we reach the last 
            row we stop. In this approach we have used backtracking approach with modification as we check if sufficient neighbors are 
            affected by the change then only, we go for it otherwise, we move to other light.
