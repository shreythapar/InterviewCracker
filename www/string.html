        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
            You are given a string S with length N. You may perform the following operation 
            any number of times: choose a non-empty substring of S (possibly the whole string S)
            such that each character occurs an even number of times <b>in this substring</b> 
            and erase this substring from S. (The parts of S before and after the erased 
            substring are concatenated and the next operation is performed on this shorter 
            string.)<br />
            For example, from the string "ac<b>abba</b>d", we can erase the highlighted substring 
            "abba", since each character occurs an even number of times in this substring. After 
            this operation, the remaining string is "acd".<br />
            Is it possible to erase the whole string using one or more operations?<br />
            Note: <br />A string B is a substring of a string A if B can be obtained from A by 
            deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several 
            (possibly none or all) characters from the end.
        </p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number 
                    of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.</li>
                    <li>The second line contains a single string S with length N.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible 
            to erase the whole string or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
        </p>
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1≤T≤2001≤T≤200
                <li>1≤N≤1,0001≤N≤1,000</li>
                <li>S contains only lowercase English letters</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Now, the aim of the given algorithm is to find the possibility of erasing a string for 
            a condition, where we choose a substring from the given string and check for each 
            character having an even number of occurrences. On finding the substring which satisfies 
            the condition, we erase it from the given string, thus forming a new string. This step 
            keeps taking place recursively till the string is empty or there are no more possibilities 
            for the string to deplete any further. So, we start by enquiring the user for the number 
            of test cases. Next, we move to the size of the string, this step is important as it helps 
            us in deciding the size of the array which would be made to store the characters of the 
            string. Finally, the user would enter the string for checking the possibility given above.
        </p>
        <p>
            On receiving the above-mentioned input, we would first make an array of the size “N” of the 
            given string, “S”. Next up, we fill the array using the characters of the string after which 
            we call a function, “check ()” passing the string through it. On entering the function, an 
            empty array is made for storing the frequency of the characters’ occurrences namely, “freq” 
            having a storage capacity of 26 owing to the letters of the alphabet. After storing the length 
            of the passed array, “S” in “n”, we make a for loop for scanning all the occurrences of the 
            characters.In scanning, <span>we scan the ASCII values of each of the characters and subtract the 
            value from 97, the reason being, 97 is the ASCII value of the first letter of the alphabet, “a”, 
            so, all the characters in the string would obviously have an ASCII value greater than 96 but less 
            than 124,</span> owing to the letters of the alphabet being 26. Now, suppose the example we picked us was, 
            “cabbac”. So the first letter, “c” has an ASCII value of 99, but, since it’s difference between 97 
            is 2, the value in the 2<sup>nd</sup> element (i.e. 0) of “freq” array would be incremented  by 1, 
            displaying the number of occurrences of the character. Similarly, for “a”, the 0<sup>th</sup> element 
            in the “freq” array would be incremented by 1. And, by the end of the scanning of the elements, the 
            0<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> position would have a value of 2 owing to two 
            occurrences of “a”, “b” and “c” respectively. Finally, a for-loop is run for checking for all the 
            elements in the array, “freq” being divisible by 2, the condition here being that, if even one stored 
            element is not divisible by 2, the function “check ()” would return false, else, true. So, on returning 
            false for each condition, we display, “NO” to the user and when true is returned, “YES” is displayed.
